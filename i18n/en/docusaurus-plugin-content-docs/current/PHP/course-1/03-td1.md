# üìö | Exercise 1: First scripts

## Clone the project

Clone the project from https://github.com/PHP-BUT2-DACS/TP-TD

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PHP-BUT2-DACS/TP-TD.git
```

:::warning
**This project will be useful throughout the module**. Keep it safe!
:::

## Do the exercises

1. In a terminal, run the command `php -v` (or `php --version`) to find out the version of your PHP interpreter.

2. Then, navigate to the project folder `/Session 1/Exercise1`. Then start the PHP server with the following command:

```shell
php -S localhost:8080
```

<details>
    <summary>Understand the command</summary>

- `php` refers to the PHP interpreter pre-installed on your machine.
- The `-S` option (for **Server**) allows you to **create a PHP server**. This option requires two parameters:
    - `<addr>`, which is **the address at which we want to use our server** (`localhost`, corresponds to the local host)
    - `<port>` allows you to specify **the port to use** for the previously provided address. In computing, it is commonly accepted that ports 808X, 800X, 300X, 500X are reserved for development.
</details>

3. Open the browser to the URL [http://localhost:8080/exercise1.php](http://localhost:8080/exercise1.php)

4. Once the command is run and the URL is opened, your terminal should display something similar to:

5. Answer the exercises in Exercise 1. You can ask for help if needed.

:::tip
The command `php -h` (or `php --help`) can help you if you are lost with other PHP commands.

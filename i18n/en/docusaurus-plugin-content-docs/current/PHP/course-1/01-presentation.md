# Introduction to the subject and objectives

The subject revolves around the development, design, and deployment of secure WEB applications. It is fully integrated into the DACS (Deployment of Communicating and Secure Applications) course. Throughout this course, we will learn PHP, a famous web language, as well as one of its frameworks, "Laravel." You will also be sensitized to web security and autonomous application deployment.

Various types of headings indicating the type of content:

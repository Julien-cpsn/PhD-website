# üìö | Exercise 3: Forms and Predefined Variables

This exercise aims to create a minimalist and non-secure system for user login and account creation.
A JSON file named `users.json` will be used to store the users.
The HTML form inputs have intentionally been simplified to facilitate the testing process of your code (if I had added `required`, you would have to fill in the fields each time).

## Clone the project

If not already done, clone the project from https://github.com/PHP-BUT2-DACS/TP-TD

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PHP-BUT2-DACS/TP-TD.git
```

## Do the exercises

1. Start the PHP server in the `/Session 2/Exercise3` directory

```shell
php -S localhost:8080
```

2. Access the page http://localhost:8080/login.php

3. Complete the exercises in Exercise 3. Feel free to ask for help if needed.

:::tip
To progress better in the exercise, it is recommended to fill in the files in this order:

1. `profile.php`
2. `logout.php`
3. `signup.php`
4. `login.php`

:::tip
Don't forget to check your `users.json` file after creating a user.

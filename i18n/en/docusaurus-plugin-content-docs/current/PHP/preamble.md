### WEB Development

> 1.3.1 - page 182

**Targeted skills:**

- Develop – that is, design, code, test, and integrate – an IT solution for a client.
- Propose optimized IT applications based on specific criteria: execution time, accuracy, resource consumption...
- Install, configure, make available, maintain in operational conditions infrastructures, services, and networks, and optimize the IT system of an organization.
- Design, manage, administer, and exploit company data and provide all the information for effective business management SAÉ in which the resource can be mobilized and combined:
- SAÉ 3.Deploi.01 | Creation and deployment of application services

**Description:**

The objective of this resource is to continue learning programming around web technologies. This resource
puts students in a development situation based on specifications, which is the logical continuation of learning development.
Studied reference knowledge:
- Web programming (e.g.: client-side or server-side, context management, authentication, web services...)
- Awareness of web security (e.g.: injection, filtering...)
- Awareness of application security (e.g.: password encoding, input typing...)

**Suggested extensions:**
- Introduction to architecture patterns (e.g.: MVC...)

**Critical targeted learnings:**
- AC21.01 | Develop and implement functional and non-functional specifications based on requirements
- AC21.02 | Apply principles of accessibility and ergonomics
- AC21.03 | Adopt good design and programming practices
- AC22.03 | Understand the issues and means of data and code security
- AC23.03 | Secure a system’s services and data
- AC24.03 | Organize data restitution through programming and visualization
- AC24.04 | Handle heterogeneous data

**Keywords:** Web programming – Specifications – Security

**Hourly volume:** Nationally defined hourly volume: 26 hours including 20 hours of practical work

### Software Architecture

> 2.3.1 - Page 204

**Targeted skills:**
- Develop – that is, design, code, test, and integrate – an IT solution for a client.
- Install, configure, make available, maintain in operational conditions infrastructures, services, and networks, and optimize the IT system of an organization.
- Acquire, develop, and utilize the skills necessary to work effectively in an IT team SAÉ in which the resource can be mobilized and combined:
- SAÉ 4.Deploi.01 | Deploy and secure services in a network

**Description:**
The objective of this resource is to present programming components that can be used in various
fields.

**Studied reference knowledge:**
- Architecture patterns (e.g.: MVC, MVVM...)
- Use of software components, programming interfaces, third-party libraries
- Development of web services

**Suggested extensions:**
- Use of web services (e.g.: asynchronous requests, data exchange formats...)
- Organization of data access: databases, directories, web services...

**Critical targeted learnings:**
- AC21.01 | Develop and implement functional and non-functional specifications based on requirements

  abstract = {The conventional approach for building pervasive environments relies on middleware to integrate different systems. Instead, we have built a system that can deal with these environments by exporting system resources through distributed virtual file systems. This requires no middleware, simplifies interoperation, and permits applying general purpose tools to any system resource. A constraint-based file system import mechanism allows the system to adapt to changes in the environment and permits users to customize the environment and tailor adaptation according to their needs. The system has been in use for over a year to carry out our daily work and is underlying the smart space that we built for our department},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of autonomous driving technologies, a vast array of autonomous driving algorithms and platforms have emerged. These algorithms and platforms are usually designed for different tasks in specific scenarios, which makes them incompatible with each other. To solve the problem, we propose a ubiquitous operating system named Parallel Driving Operating System (PDOS) based on the parallel driving theory. Specifically, the PDOS architecture includes the hardware layer, the kernel layer, the functional layer, and the application layer, which can realize heterogeneous hardware support, ubiquitous resource management, algorithm optimization, and ubiquitous application development, respectively. Moreover, we derive the PDOS into specific operating systems in four application scenarios, i.e., intelligent mining, intelligent warehousing, intelligent logistics, and intelligent port. To validate the PDOS, we test its usability, reliability, and efficiency in these scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate the high performance of PDOS in multiple autonomous driving, and indicate that PDOS is an efficient operating system for parallel driving.},

  abstract = {The metaverse signifies the amalgamation of virtual and tangible realms through human-computer interaction. The seamless integration of human, cyber, and environments within ubiquitous computing plays a pivotal role in fully harnessing the metaverse's capabilities. Nevertheless, metaverse operating systems face substantial hurdles in terms of accessing ubiquitous resources, processing information while safeguarding privacy and security, and furnishing artificial intelligence capabilities to downstream applications. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces the UbiMeta model, a specialized ubiquitous operating system designed specifically for the metaverse. It extends the capabilities of traditional ubiquitous operating systems and focuses on adapting downstream models and operational capacity to effectively function within the metaverse. UbiMeta comprises four layers: the Ubiquitous Resource Management Layer (URML), the Autonomous Information Mastery Layer (AIML), the General Intelligence Mechanism Layer (GIML), and the Metaverse Ecological Model Layer (MEML). The URML facilitates the seamless incorporation and management of various external devices and resources. It provides a framework for integrating and controlling these resources, including virtualization, abstraction, and reuse. The AIML is responsible for perceiving information and safeguarding privacy and security during storage and processing. The GIML leverages large-scale pre-trained deep-learning feature extractors to obtain effective features for processing information. The MEML focuses on constructing metaverse applications using the principles of Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) and the OODA loop (Observation, Orientation, Decision, Action). It leverages the vast amount of information collected by the URML and AIML layers to build a robust metaverse ecosystem. Furthermore, this study explores how UbiMeta enhances user experiences and fosters innovation in various metaverse domains. It highlights the potential of UbiMeta in revolutionizing medical healthcare, industrial practices, education, and agriculture within the metaverse.},

  abstract = {With the rise of crowdsourcing and mobile crowdsensing techniques, a large number of crowdsourcing applications or platforms ({\textbackslash}mathbb CAPCAP) have appeared. In the mean time, {\textbackslash}mathbb CAPCAP-related models and frameworks based on different research hypotheses are rapidly emerging, and they usually address specific issues from a certain perspective. Due to different settings and conditions, different models are not compatible with each other. However, {\textbackslash}mathbb CAPCAP urgently needs to combine these techniques to form a unified framework. In addition, these models needs to be learned and updated online with the extension of crowdsourced data and task types; thus, requiring a unified architecture that integrates lifelong learning concepts and breaks down the barriers between different modules. This paper draws on the idea of ubiquitous operating systems and proposes a novel OS (CrowdOS), which is an abstract software layer running between native OS and application layer. In particular, based on an in-depth analysis of the complex crowd environment and diverse characteristics of heterogeneous tasks, we construct the OS kernel and three core frameworks including task resolution and assignment framework (TRAF), integrated resource management (IRM), and task result quality optimization (TRO). In addition, we validate the usability of CrowdOS, module correctness and development efficiency. Our evaluation further reveals TRO brings enormous improvement in efficiency and a reduction in energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Future data-intensive intelligent applications are required to traverse across the cloud-to-edge-to-IoT continuum, where cloud and edge resources elegantly coordinate, alongside sensor networks and data. However, current technical solutions can only partially handle the data outburst associated with the IoT proliferation experienced in recent years, mainly due to their hierarchical architectures. In this context, this paper presents a reference architecture of a meta-operating system (RAMOS), targeted to enable a dynamic, distributed and trusted continuum which will be capable of facilitating the next-generation smart applications at the edge. RAMOS is domain-agnostic, capable of supporting heterogeneous devices in various network environments. Furthermore, the proposed architecture possesses the ability to place the data at the origin in a secure and trusted manner. Based on a layered structure, the building blocks of RAMOS are thoroughly described, and the interconnection and coordination between them is fully presented. Furthermore, illustration of how the proposed reference architecture and its characteristics could fit in potential key industrial and societal applications, which in the future will require more power at the edge, is provided in five practical scenarios, focusing on the distributed intelligence and privacy preservation principles promoted by RAMOS, as well as the concept of environmental footprint minimization. Finally, the business potential of an open edge ecosystem and the societal impacts of climate net neutrality are also illustrated.},

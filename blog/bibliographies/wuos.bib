  abstract = {The conventional approach for building pervasive environments relies on middleware to integrate different systems. Instead, we have built a system that can deal with these environments by exporting system resources through distributed virtual file systems. This requires no middleware, simplifies interoperation, and permits applying general purpose tools to any system resource. A constraint-based file system import mechanism allows the system to adapt to changes in the environment and permits users to customize the environment and tailor adaptation according to their needs. The system has been in use for over a year to carry out our daily work and is underlying the smart space that we built for our department},

These algorithms and platforms are usually designed for different tasks in specific scenarios, which makes them incompatible with each other. To solve the problem, we propose a ubiquitous operating system named Parallel Driving Operating System (PDOS) based on the parallel driving theory. Specifically, the PDOS architecture includes the hardware layer, the kernel layer, the functional layer, and the application layer, which can realize heterogeneous hardware support, ubiquitous resource management, algorithm optimization, and ubiquitous application development, respectively. Moreover, we derive the PDOS into specific operating systems in four application scenarios, i.e., intelligent mining, intelligent warehousing, intelligent logistics, and intelligent port. To validate the PDOS, we test its usability, reliability, and efficiency in these scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate the high performance of PDOS in multiple autonomous driving, and indicate that PDOS is an efficient operating system for parallel driving.},

  abstract = {The metaverse signifies the amalgamation of virtual and tangible realms through human-computer interaction. The seamless integration of human, cyber, and environments within ubiquitous computing plays a pivotal role in fully harnessing the metaverse's capabilities. Nevertheless, metaverse operating systems face substantial hurdles in terms of accessing ubiquitous resources, processing information while safeguarding privacy and security, and furnishing artificial intelligence capabilities to downstream applications. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces the UbiMeta model, a specialized ubiquitous operating system designed specifically for the metaverse. It extends the capabilities of traditional ubiquitous operating systems and focuses on adapting downstream models and operational capacity to effectively function within the metaverse. UbiMeta comprises four layers: the Ubiquitous Resource Management Layer (URML), the Autonomous Information Mastery Layer (AIML), the General Intelligence Mechanism Layer (GIML), and the Metaverse Ecological Model Layer (MEML). The URML facilitates the seamless incorporation and management of various external devices and resources. It provides a framework for integrating and controlling these resources, including virtualization, abstraction, and reuse. The AIML is responsible for perceiving information and safeguarding privacy and security during storage and processing. The GIML leverages large-scale pre-trained deep-learning feature extractors to obtain effective features for processing information. The MEML focuses on constructing metaverse applications using the principles of Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) and the OODA loop (Observation, Orientation, Decision, Action). It leverages the vast amount of information collected by the URML and AIML layers to build a robust metaverse ecosystem. Furthermore, this study explores how UbiMeta enhances user experiences and fosters innovation in various metaverse domains. It highlights the potential of UbiMeta in revolutionizing medical healthcare, industrial practices, education, and agriculture within the metaverse.},

  abstract = {By integrating Software-Defined Networking and cloud computing, virtualized networking and computing resources can be dynamically reallocated through live migration of Virtual Machines (VMs). Dynamic resource management such as load balancing and energy-saving policies can request multiple migrations when the algorithms are triggered periodically. There exist notable research efforts in dynamic resource management that alleviate single migration overheads, such as single migration time and co-location interference while selecting the potential VMs and migration destinations. However, by neglecting the resource dependency among potential migration requests, the existing solutions of dynamic resource management can result in the Quality of Service (QoS) degradation and Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during the migration schedule. Therefore, it is essential to integrate both single and multiple migration overheads into VM reallocation planning. In this paper, we propose a concurrency-aware multiple migration selector that operates based on the maximal cliques and independent sets of the resource dependency graph of multiple migration requests. Our proposed method can be integrated with existing dynamic resource management policies. The experimental results demonstrate that our solution efficiently minimizes migration interference and shortens the convergence time of reallocation by maximizing the multiple migration performance while achieving the objective of dynamic resource management.},

Using live migration, cloud providers can address their dynamic resource management and fault tolerance objectives without interrupting the service of users. However, performing multiple live migrations in arbitrary order can lead to service degradation. Therefore, efficient migration planning is essential to reduce the impact of live migration overheads. In addition, to prevent Quality of Service (QoS) degradations and Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations, it is necessary to set priorities for different live migration requests with various urgency. In this paper, we propose SLAMIG, a set of algorithms that composes deadline-aware multiple migration grouping algorithm and on-line migration scheduling to determine the sequence of VM/VNF migrations. The experimental results show that our approach with reasonable algorithm runtime can efficiently reduce the number of deadline misses and has a good migration performance compared with the one-by-one scheduling and two state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of total migration time, average execution time, downtime, and transferred data. We also evaluate and analyze the impact of multiple migrations on QoS and energy consumption.},

Such an environment is distributed and competitive in nature. In this paper, we take a game theoretical approach to computation offloading optimization in a fog computing environment. Such an approach captures and characterizes the nature of a competitive environment. The main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows. First, we formulate a non-cooperative game with both UEs and MECs as players. Each UE attempts to minimize the execution time of its tasks with an energy constraint. Each MEC attempts to minimize the product of its power consumption for computation and execution time for allocated tasks. Second, we develop a heuristic algorithm for a UE to determine its ``heuristically'' best response to the current situation, an algorithm for an MEC to determine its best response to the current situation, and an iterative algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium. Third, we prove that our iterative algorithm converges to a Nash equilibrium. We demonstrate numerical examples of our non-cooperative games with and without MECs' participation. We observe that our iterative algorithm always quickly converges to a Nash equilibrium. The uniqueness of our non-cooperative games is that the strategy set of a player can be discrete and the payoff function of a player can be obtained by a heuristic algorithm for combinatorial optimization. To the best of the author's knowledge, there has been no such investigation of non-cooperative games based on combinatorial optimization for computation offloading optimization in a fog computing environment.},

  abstract = {With the rise of crowdsourcing and mobile crowdsensing techniques, a large number of crowdsourcing applications or platforms ({\textbackslash}mathbb CAPCAP) have appeared. In the mean time, {\textbackslash}mathbb CAPCAP-related models and frameworks based on different research hypotheses are rapidly emerging, and they usually address specific issues from a certain perspective. Due to different settings and conditions, different models are not compatible with each other. However, {\textbackslash}mathbb CAPCAP urgently needs to combine these techniques to form a unified framework. In addition, these models needs to be learned and updated online with the extension of crowdsourced data and task types; thus, requiring a unified architecture that integrates lifelong learning concepts and breaks down the barriers between different modules. This paper draws on the idea of ubiquitous operating systems and proposes a novel OS (CrowdOS), which is an abstract software layer running between native OS and application layer. In particular, based on an in-depth analysis of the complex crowd environment and diverse characteristics of heterogeneous tasks, we construct the OS kernel and three core frameworks including task resolution and assignment framework (TRAF), integrated resource management (IRM), and task result quality optimization (TRO). In addition, we validate the usability of CrowdOS, module correctness and development efficiency. Our evaluation further reveals TRO brings enormous improvement in efficiency and a reduction in energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Network Function Virtualization (NFV) decouples network functions from dedicated hardware devices into Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). These VNFs are chained in order as a Service Function Chain (SFC) to provision flexible and efficient services. When service requests dynamically increase, the intensive workloads often lead to node overloads and further impact the Quality of Service (QoS). Existing works address this problem by migrating VNFs from overload nodes to other low-load nodes, known as VNF migration. However, when a VNF is shared by multiple SFCs, migrating the VNF will change the mapping relationships between these SFCs and the physical network (nodes and links). That may make some SFCs traverse more links and increase their propagation latency. That violates the demand of users for low-latency services. In this paper, to minimize the impact of VNF migration on SFC latency, we propose partial VNF migration. It migrates only partial VNFs within these SFCs to minimize the overall SFC latency while reducing migration costs. As such, we leverage partial VNF migration for efficient latency minimization with the formulation of an integer linear programming (ILP) model. Given the NP-hard nature of the problem, we propose a dynamic latency-aware partial VNF migration algorithm to reduce node overloads and minimize SFC latency. Evaluation indicates that the proposed approach has 12.7\%--21.8\% lower average SFC latency and 12.5\%--48.5\% less migration cost than state-of-the-art VNF migration algorithms. And it demonstrates about 90\% shorter execution time with similar minimization performance, compared to other SFC reconfiguration algorithms.},

  abstract = {Meta computing is a new computing paradigm that aims to efficiently utilize all network computing resources to provide fault-tolerant, personalized services with strong security and privacy guarantees. It also seeks to virtualize the Internet as many meta computers. In meta computing, tasks can be assigned to containers at edge nodes for processing, based on container images with multiple layers. The dynamic and resource-constrained nature of meta computing environments requires an optimal container migration strategy for mobile users to minimize latency. However, the problem of container migration in meta computing has not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we present low-latency, layer-aware container migration strategies that consider both proactive and passive migration. Specifically: 1) We formulate the container migration problem in meta computing, taking into account layer dependencies to reduce migration costs and overall task duration by considering four delays. 2) We introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm based on policy gradients to minimize total latency by identifying layer dependencies for action selection, making decisions for both proactive and passive migration. Expert demonstrations are introduced to enhance exploitation. 3) Experiments using real data trajectories show that the algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving lower total latency.},

  abstract = {Fog computing is a promising paradigm aimed at reducing latency and network traffic between end devices and cloud servers. In fog computing systems, a fog node can be overloaded by an increased number of requests from end devices. In this situation, an efficient offloading mechanism among fog nodes is necessary to meet the requirements of fog computing. Software Defined Networking (SDN) has become the de facto standard for future network infrastructures, including fog computing systems. In this paper, we propose a dynamic offloading service among fog nodes for an SDN-based fog computing system that aims at selecting an optimal offloading node and assisting the offloading path by providing an end-to-end bandwidth guarantee based on SDN technology. The proposed solution outperforms traditional approaches without SDN technology in terms of both throughput and request response time by selecting the appropriate offloading node using current computational and network resource information and providing a reliable end-to-end path.},

  abstract = {Future data-intensive intelligent applications are required to traverse across the cloud-to-edge-to-IoT continuum, where cloud and edge resources elegantly coordinate, alongside sensor networks and data. However, current technical solutions can only partially handle the data outburst associated with the IoT proliferation experienced in recent years, mainly due to their hierarchical architectures. In this context, this paper presents a reference architecture of a meta-operating system (RAMOS), targeted to enable a dynamic, distributed and trusted continuum which will be capable of facilitating the next-generation smart applications at the edge. RAMOS is domain-agnostic, capable of supporting heterogeneous devices in various network environments. Furthermore, the proposed architecture possesses the ability to place the data at the origin in a secure and trusted manner. Based on a layered structure, the building blocks of RAMOS are thoroughly described, and the interconnection and coordination between them is fully presented. Furthermore, illustration of how the proposed reference architecture and its characteristics could fit in potential key industrial and societal applications, which in the future will require more power at the edge, is provided in five practical scenarios, focusing on the distributed intelligence and privacy preservation principles promoted by RAMOS, as well as the concept of environmental footprint minimization. Finally, the business potential of an open edge ecosystem and the societal impacts of climate net neutrality are also illustrated.},
